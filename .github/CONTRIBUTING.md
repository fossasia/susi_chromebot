**Commits**
* Follow this template while creating issues and before making a PR.
* Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
* Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (More info at https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests )
* When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a failing travis build or some small style corrections or minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterwards so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git )
* When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. You can also upload a working gif of the changes you made using any GIF applications like ScreentoGIF. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.

**Feature Requests and Bug Reports**
* When you file a feature request or when you are submitting a bug report to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/fossasia/susi_chromebot/issues), make sure you add steps to reproduce it. Especially if that bug is some weird/rare one.

**Join the development**
* Before you join development, please set up the system on your local machine and go through the application completely. Press on any link/button you can find and see where it leads to. Explore. (Don't worry ... Nothing will happen to the app or to you due to the exploring :wink: Only thing that will happen is, you'll be more familiar with what is where and might even get some cool ideas on how to improve various aspects of the app.)
* If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.

**Review Policy**

Pull requests must be reviewed before merge. The goal is to have two people review the pull request. With this we want to spread the knowledge about the project and encourage positive feedback.

- A pull-request with **two** positive reviews of contributors should be merged by the last reviewer and can be merged by anyone with write access.
- A pull-request with **one** positive review of contributors can be merged after 24 hours by anyone with write access.
- A pull-request with **no** positive review can be merged after three days by anyone with write access.

Note that this does not clarify what to do if there a negative reviews.
The goal is again to spread knowledge and feedback but also prevent frustration and stagnation of the project.
