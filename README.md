# Chrome extension to access SUSI.AI

Hi. This is a chrome extension to access SUSI.AI.
Why? We have the SUSI web client, however certain situations we don't want to leave the current browsing tab, and to access SUSI we would have to move to the next tab. But with SUSI.AI chrome extension, access SUSI.AI from any tabs while browsing without having to leave the tab.

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fossasia/susi_chromebot
$ cd susi_chromebot
$ cd src
```

1. Clone this repository.
2. Goto `chrome://extensions` on your chrome browser.
3. Turn on developer mode if not already on.
4. Load unpacked extension from `src` folder.
5. Click on the SUSI icon you see on your browser toolbar.
